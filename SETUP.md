# Email to Lunch Money - Setup Guide

This guide will walk you through setting up the email-to-lunchmoney service to automatically enrich your Lunch Money transactions with details from receipt emails.

## Overview

The setup process involves four main steps:

1. **Gmail Label Setup** - Configure Gmail to automatically label receipt emails that should be processed
2. **Google Apps Script Deployment** - Deploy a script that monitors labeled emails and POSTs them to the Worker endpoint
3. **Cloudflare Workers Deployment** - Deploy the main processing service on Cloudflare
4. **Service Configuration** - Configure API tokens, authentication, optional Telegram notifications, and other settings

The service will parse receipt emails from supported services (Amazon, Lyft, Apple, Cloudflare), extract transaction details, and automatically update your Lunch Money transactions with notes or split them into itemized line items.

> [!TIP]
> **Setting up with AI assistance:** You can paste this entire guide into an AI coding agent (like Claude Code or GitHub Copilot) to get step-by-step guidance and have the agent run commands for you.

<details>
<summary><strong>For AI Agents: Setup Guidance Instructions</strong></summary>

If you're an AI agent helping a user set up this service, follow these guidelines:

1. **Work through the guide step-by-step** - Don't skip ahead. Complete each section fully before moving to the next.

2. **Run commands for the user** - When the guide shows a command, offer to run it unless the user says they'll do it themselves.

3. **Verify each step** - After completing a step, verify it worked (e.g., check if files were created, read configuration files, check command output).

4. **Ask clarifying questions** - If the guide mentions configuration choices (e.g., trigger frequency, domain name), ask the user for their preference.

5. **Handle errors gracefully** - If a command fails, check the Troubleshooting section and help debug the issue.

6. **Track progress** - Keep the user informed about which step you're on and what's coming next.

7. **Test thoroughly** - When you reach Step 5 (Verification and Testing), guide the user through actually testing the system end-to-end.

8. **Don't assume existing setup** - Treat this as a fresh installation unless the user explicitly tells you otherwise.

The user should have their API keys ready (Lunch Money, OpenAI) and a Cloudflare account.

## Prerequisites

**Important:** Please ensure all prerequisites are met before beginning the setup process.

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Gmail account with receipt emails you want to process
- A [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app) account
- An [OpenAI API account](https://platform.openai.com) (for AI-powered parsing)
- A [Cloudflare account](https://cloudflare.com) (free tier works fine)
- Node.js installed (v18 or later recommended)
- Basic familiarity with command line tools and git

**Optional:**
- A Telegram bot (for notifications about old unprocessed actions)


## 1. Gmail Label Setup

The first step is to configure Gmail to automatically apply a label to receipt emails that should be forwarded to the service.

> [!NOTE]
> **Using gmailctl for filter management**
>
> If you manage many Gmail filters, consider using [gmailctl](https://github.com/mbrt/gmailctl) to define filters as code. This makes it easier to version control and maintain complex filter setups.
>
> See [evanpurkhiser/gmailctl-personal](https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/gmailctl-personal) for a complete example configuration, including the Lunch Money forwarding rules starting at [line 758](https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/gmailctl-personal/blob/main/evanpurkhiser@gmail.com.jsonnet#L758).

### 1.1 Create the Gmail Label

1. Open Gmail in your browser
2. In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **"Create new label"** (or go to Settings → Labels → Create new label)
3. Create a label named: `Fwd / Lunch Money`
4. Click **Create**

### 1.2 Create Gmail Filters

Now you'll create filters to automatically apply this label to specific receipt emails. The service currently supports:

- **Amazon** - Order confirmations
- **Lyft** - Ride and bike rental receipts
- **Apple** - App Store and iTunes receipts
- **Cloudflare** - Invoices (with PDF attachments)

</details>


## 2. Google Apps Script Deployment

The Apps Script monitors emails with the `Fwd / Lunch Money` label and POSTs them to the Cloudflare Worker endpoint.

### 2.1 Install clasp (Google Apps Script CLI)

```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
```

### 2.2 Authenticate with Google

```bash
clasp login
```

This will open a browser window to authenticate with your Google account. Grant the necessary permissions.

### 2.3 Clone and Configure the Script

1. Clone this repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/email-to-lunchmoney.git
   cd email-to-lunchmoney
   ```

2. Navigate to the Apps Script directory:
   ```bash
   cd google-app-script
   ```

3. Create a new Apps Script project:
   ```bash
   clasp create --type standalone --title "Email to Lunch Money Forwarder"
   ```

   This will create a `.clasp.json` file with your script ID.

4. Edit `.clasp.json` to add TypeScript support by adding `".ts"` to the `scriptExtensions` array:
   ```json
   {
     "scriptId": "...",
     "rootDir": "",
     "scriptExtensions": [".ts", ".js", ".gs"],
     ...
   }
   ```

5. Deploy the script:
   ```bash
   clasp push
   ```

   This uploads the script to Google Apps Script.

   **Note:** We'll configure the script properties and trigger in Step 5, after deploying the Cloudflare Worker.


## 3. Cloudflare Workers Deployment

Now you'll deploy the main processing service on Cloudflare Workers.

### 3.1 Install Dependencies

From the root of the repository:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
pnpm install
```

### 3.2 Authenticate with Cloudflare

```bash
wrangler login
```

This will open a browser window to authenticate with your Cloudflare account.

### 3.3 Create a D1 Database

The service uses Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) to store pending actions.

```bash
wrangler d1 create email-to-lunchmoney
```

This will output a database ID. Copy it.

### 3.4 Update wrangler.jsonc

Open `wrangler.jsonc` and update the placeholder values:

1. **Replace the database ID** with the ID from the previous step:
   ```jsonc
   "database_id": "YOUR_DATABASE_ID_HERE"  // Replace with your database ID
   ```

The `wrangler.jsonc` should have the database configuration like:
```jsonc
{
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "email-to-lunchmoney",
      "database_id": "your-actual-database-id-here"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3.5 Apply Database Migrations

```bash
wrangler d1 migrations apply email-to-lunchmoney --remote
```

This creates the necessary database tables in your remote Cloudflare database.

### 3.6 Deploy the Worker

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

This will:
- Bundle your TypeScript code
- Upload it to Cloudflare Workers
- Configure the scheduled trigger (every 30 minutes)
- Set up the HTTP /ingest endpoint

You should see output indicating successful deployment:
```
Published email-to-lunchmoney (X.XX sec)
  https://email-to-lunchmoney.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

**Important:** Copy this Worker URL - you'll need it to configure the `INGEST_URL` in your Apps Script properties (in Step 4.1).


## 4. Service Configuration

Finally, configure the service with your API tokens and optional settings.

### 4.1 Required Secrets and Configuration

You'll need to set the following secrets and configuration:

#### INGEST_TOKEN - Authentication Token

First, generate a secure random token for authenticating requests to your Worker:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

This will output a secure random token (e.g., `696b1b2b7fdd1dee2c425cd331740d9f...`). Copy this token.

Set it as a Cloudflare secret:
```bash
wrangler secret put INGEST_TOKEN
```
Paste your token when prompted.

**Important:** Save this token - you'll need it to configure your Apps Script in Step 5.

#### Lunch Money API Key

1. Log in to [Lunch Money](https://my.lunchmoney.app)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Developers**
3. Create a new API token (or use an existing one)
4. Copy the token and set it in Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put LUNCHMONEY_API_KEY
   ```
   Paste your token when prompted.

#### OpenAI API Key

1. Log in to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com)
2. Go to **API Keys** (in your account settings)
3. Create a new secret key
4. Copy the key and set it in Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```
   Paste your key when prompted.

**Note:** The service uses OpenAI for parsing complex receipt data (e.g., shortening Amazon item names, parsing Cloudflare invoices). Costs are typically minimal (~$0.01-0.05 per month for normal usage).

### 4.2 Optional: Telegram Notifications

Telegram notifications are useful for monitoring the health of your email-to-lunchmoney service. You'll receive alerts when receipt emails have been processed but couldn't be matched to transactions in Lunch Money for 15+ days. This helps you identify issues such as:

- Transactions that haven't been imported into Lunch Money yet
- Mismatched payee names between the receipt and transaction
- Amount discrepancies preventing automatic matching
- Transactions that were already cleared/reviewed before matching could occur

If you want to enable Telegram notifications:

#### Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts to create a new bot
3. Copy the bot token provided by BotFather
4. Set the token in Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_TOKEN
   ```

#### Get Your Chat ID

1. Send a message to your bot (or add it to a group/channel)
2. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
3. Look for the `chat` object in the response and copy the `id` value
4. Set the chat ID in Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
   ```

**What notifications will I receive?**
- Alerts when actions are older than 15 days and haven't been matched to transactions
- This helps you identify receipt emails that couldn't be automatically processed

### 4.3 Optional: Sentry Error Tracking

If you want centralized error tracking (recommended for production use):

1. Create a free account at [sentry.io](https://sentry.io)
2. Create a new project (select "Cloudflare Workers" as the platform)
3. Copy your DSN (Data Source Name)
4. Set the DSN as a secret in Cloudflare:
   ```bash
   wrangler secret put SENTRY_DSN
   ```
   Paste your DSN when prompted (e.g., `https://...@...sentry.io/...`)

### 4.4 Configuration Variables

Additional configuration is available in the source code:

- **Old Action Threshold** (`src/old-actions-checker.ts`): Currently 15 days. Actions older than this trigger notifications.
- **Cleanup Threshold** (`src/old-action-cleanup.ts`): Currently 30 days. Notified actions older than this are deleted.
- **Scheduled Frequency** (`wrangler.jsonc`): Currently every 30 minutes (`*/30 * * * *`)


## 5. Configure Apps Script

Now that the worker is deployed and configured, let's configure the Apps Script to connect to it.

### 5.1 Configure Script Properties

1. Open your Apps Script project:
   ```bash
   cd google-app-script
   clasp open-script
   ```

   Or go directly to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) and open your project.

2. In the Apps Script editor, click **Project Settings** (gear icon in the left sidebar)

3. Scroll down to **Script Properties** and click **Add script property**

4. Add the following properties:

   | Property Name | Value | Description |
   |--------------|-------|-------------|
   | `GMAIL_LABEL` | `Fwd / Lunch Money` | The Gmail label to monitor |
   | `INGEST_URL` | `https://email-to-lunchmoney.your-subdomain.workers.dev/ingest` | Your Worker endpoint URL from Step 3 |
   | `INGEST_TOKEN` | _(your token from Step 4.1)_ | Authentication token for the Worker |

   **Note:** For `INGEST_URL`, use the Worker URL from Step 3.6. For `INGEST_TOKEN`, use the token you generated and saved in Step 4.1.

5. Click **Save script properties**

### 5.2 Configure the Trigger

The script needs to run periodically to check for new labeled emails.

1. In the Apps Script editor, click the **clock icon** (Triggers) in the left sidebar

2. Click **"+ Add Trigger"** (bottom right)

3. Configure the trigger:
   - **Choose which function to run:** `findAndForwardEmails`
   - **Choose which deployment should run:** `Head`
   - **Select event source:** `Time-driven`
   - **Select type of time based trigger:** `Minutes timer` or `Hour timer`
   - **Select minute/hour interval:** Every 30 minutes or Every 1 hour (your preference)
     - Note: Gmail quotas limit email processing to ~100/day, so hourly is usually sufficient

4. Click **Save**

5. **Authorize the app** - You'll see a Google security warning screen saying "Google hasn't verified this app":
   - Click **"Advanced"** at the bottom
   - Click **"Go to Email to Lunch Money Forwarder (unsafe)"**
   - Review the permissions and click **"Allow"**

   This is normal for personal Apps Script projects. The script needs permission to read your Gmail messages and make HTTP requests.

### 5.3 Test the Script

You can manually test the script before waiting for the trigger:

1. First, manually apply the `Fwd / Lunch Money` label to a test email in your Gmail:
   - Find any receipt email in your Gmail inbox
   - Click the label icon and select `Fwd / Lunch Money`

2. In the Apps Script editor, select the `findAndForwardEmails` function from the dropdown at the top

3. Click **Run** (play button)

4. Check the **Execution log** at the bottom to verify it ran without errors. You should see output similar to:
   ```
   Notice    Execution started
   Info      Found 1 emails to process...
   Info      Successfully sent email: [Email Subject]
   Notice    Execution completed
   ```

5. Check that the email you labeled had the `Fwd / Lunch Money` label removed (indicating it was successfully POSTed to the worker)


## 6. Verification and Testing

### 6.1 Test Email Forwarding

1. Find an existing receipt email in your Gmail (or wait for a new one)
2. Ensure it has the `Fwd / Lunch Money` label applied
3. Wait for the Apps Script trigger to run (or manually run it from the Apps Script editor)
4. Check that the label was removed from the email (indicating it was forwarded)

### 6.2 Check Worker Logs

View logs in Cloudflare to confirm the email was received and processed:

```bash
wrangler tail
```

Or view logs in the Cloudflare dashboard:
1. Go to **Workers & Pages**
2. Select `email-to-lunchmoney`
3. Click **Logs** tab

You should see log entries indicating:
- Email received
- Email parsed
- Processor matched (e.g., "Amazon", "Lyft")
- Action stored in database

### 6.3 Check Database

View pending actions in the D1 database:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute email-to-lunchmoney --command "SELECT * FROM lunchmoney_actions"
```

You should see entries with:
- `id`: Auto-incrementing ID
- `date_created`: Timestamp
- `source`: Email source (e.g., "Amazon")
- `action`: JSON-serialized action data

### 6.4 Verify Lunch Money Updates

After the scheduled worker runs (within 30 minutes), check your Lunch Money account:

1. Go to **Transactions**
2. Find the transaction matching your receipt
3. Verify it has been updated with notes or split into line items

**Matching Logic:**
- The service matches actions to transactions based on **payee name** and **amount**
- Transactions must be in the past 180 days
- Transactions must be uncleared (not marked as cleared/reviewed)

**Clean Up Test Entries:**

If you tested with an email that won't have a matching transaction in Lunch Money, you can remove the test entry from the database:

```bash
# Remove the most recent action
wrangler d1 execute email-to-lunchmoney --remote --command "DELETE FROM lunchmoney_actions WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM lunchmoney_actions ORDER BY date_created DESC LIMIT 1)"
```

Or to clear all actions:
```bash
wrangler d1 execute email-to-lunchmoney --remote --command "DELETE FROM lunchmoney_actions"
```


## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Being Forwarded

- Check that the Gmail label is spelled correctly: `Fwd / Lunch Money`
- Verify the Apps Script trigger is running (check trigger history in Apps Script editor)
- Check Apps Script execution logs for errors
- Ensure you granted Gmail permissions to the Apps Script

### Emails Not Being Processed

- Check Cloudflare Worker logs: `wrangler tail`
- Verify the `INGEST_TOKEN` matches between Worker secrets and Apps Script properties
- Verify the `INGEST_URL` in Apps Script points to the correct Worker endpoint (should end with `/ingest`)
- Check that your worker is deployed: `wrangler deployments list`
- Test the endpoint directly with curl:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://your-worker-url.workers.dev/ingest \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -d "$(cat test-email.eml | base64)"
  ```
  You should receive a 202 response if everything is configured correctly

### Actions Not Matching Transactions

- Verify the transaction exists in Lunch Money within the past 180 days
- Check that the transaction is not already cleared/reviewed
- Verify the payee name and amount match (check D1 database for expected values)
- Look for errors in Cloudflare logs during scheduled processing

### OpenAI API Errors

- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid: `wrangler secret list`
- Check your OpenAI account has available credits
- Review error messages in Cloudflare logs or Sentry

### D1 Database Errors

- Ensure migrations were applied: `wrangler d1 migrations list email-to-lunchmoney`
- Check database binding is correct in `wrangler.jsonc`
- View recent queries in Cloudflare dashboard (D1 → Select database → Metrics)


## Maintenance

### Viewing Pending Actions

```bash
wrangler d1 execute email-to-lunchmoney --command "SELECT * FROM lunchmoney_actions ORDER BY date_created DESC"
```

### Manually Deleting an Action

If an action is stuck or incorrect:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute email-to-lunchmoney --command "DELETE FROM lunchmoney_actions WHERE id = <ID>"
```

### Updating Configuration

After changing configuration in `wrangler.jsonc` or source code:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

After changing secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put SECRET_NAME
```

### Monitoring

- **Worker Logs:** `wrangler tail` or Cloudflare dashboard
- **D1 Database:** Cloudflare dashboard → D1 → Select database
- **Sentry:** [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) (if configured)
- **Telegram:** Receive notifications for old unprocessed actions


## Cost Breakdown

The service is designed to be extremely cost-effective:

| Service | Cost |
|---------|------|
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Free tier (100,000 requests/day, 10ms CPU time per request) |
| **Cloudflare D1** | Free tier (5 GB storage, 5 million reads/day, 100k writes/day) |
| **OpenAI API** | ~$0.01-0.05/month (depends on usage, mostly gpt-4o-mini) |
| **Google Apps Script** | Free |

**Expected monthly cost:** ~$0.01-0.05 (OpenAI API only)


## Security Considerations

- **Token-Based Authentication:** The service uses a secure Bearer token (`INGEST_TOKEN`) to authenticate requests to the `/ingest` endpoint. Keep this token secret and rotate it if compromised.
- **API Keys:** All secrets are stored securely in Cloudflare Workers secrets (encrypted at rest)
- **Database Access:** D1 database is only accessible by your worker
- **Email Content:** Raw email content is processed and then discarded (not permanently stored)
- **Action Data:** Only extracted metadata is stored in D1 (no full email bodies or attachments)
- **Endpoint Security:** The `/ingest` endpoint is publicly accessible but requires the authentication token.
